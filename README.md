# Movies-Analytics-in-Spark-and-Scala

# Overview
Solving analytical questions on the semi-structured [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) containing a million records using Spark and Scala. This features the use of Spark RDD, Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes executed on Spark-Shell (REPL) using Scala API. We aim to draw useful insights about users and movies by leveraging different forms of Spark APIs.

# Environment
* Linux (Ubuntu 15.04)
* Hadoop 2.7.2
* Spark 2.0.2
* Scala 2.11

# Installation steps

1. Simply clone the repository
	```
	git clone https://github.com/Thomas-George-T/Movies-Analytics-in-Spark-and-Scala.git
	```
2. In the repo, Navigate to Spark RDD, Spark SQL or Spark Dataframe locations as needed.

3. Run the execute script to view results
	```
	sh execute.sh
	```
4. The `execute.sh` will pass the scala code through spark-shell and then display the findings in the terminal from the results folder.
